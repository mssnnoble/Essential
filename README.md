This package has: a three parameter prior distribution over the space of essential graphs. theta is parameter for assignment of vertices to chain components, alpha the parameter for assignment of chain components to layers, p an 'extra edge' parameter, for additional edges over and above the 'skeleton' for an essential graph with given chain components and layers.
An essential graph can be generated, where the within-chain component edges provide a spanning tree.
A Metropolis sampler is available for posterior sampling, where the distribution over essential graphs is the prior.
