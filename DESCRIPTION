Title: Prior Distribution over Essential Graphs and Metropolis Hastings Sampler
Version: 1.0.0
Author: John M. Noble
Maintainer: The package maintainer <noble@mimuw.edu.pl>
Description: This package generates essential graphs according to a 
     probability distribution where assignment of vertices to chain components 
     and assignment of chain components to layers are based on Chinese Restaurant 
     processes with parameters theta and alpha respectively. A skeleton of edges 
     is chosen at random to ensure the structure, extra edges are added according 
     to an 'extra edge' parameter p.
     A Metropolis Hastings sampler is available, whose state space is the 
     space of essential graphs.
